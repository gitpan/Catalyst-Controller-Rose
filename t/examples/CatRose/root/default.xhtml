<p>
The CatRose project is an example Catalyst application
for demonstrating the Catalyst::Model::RDBO and Catalyst::Controller::Rose
CPAN modules.
</p>

<p>
The application is a simple CRUD-style project designed
to illustrate one-to-many and many-to-many database relations.
The metaphor used is songs and albums. A song may appear on one or more
albums; an album contains one or more songs.

Use the menu at the top to navigate. Search, create, edit and delete
records.
